# WaySync

## Overview

WaySync is a client-side JavaScript web application that helps users plan meet ups with nearby friends or helps in communting together. The app displays allows for easy map access, being interactive allowing you to interact with the users around you that you have added. Users can ping nearby friends and send them notifications or messages.
